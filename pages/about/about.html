    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Anointed Sampson Emecheta and I'm into coding, graphic design, fiction writing and machine learning. I love reading a lot and also love trying new things. I am currently running for my clearance in the university so that I can go for my youth service. I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development at Capacitybay and I hope to excel. I am a Christian and I also love telling people about Christ and He’s sacrifice on the cross for us. I’m a bit of a song writer, I learnt that from my elder brother who is into music.</p>
